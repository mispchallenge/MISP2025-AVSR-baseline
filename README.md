## Lip detection results

We provide shoulder and lip detection results in  <a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Xtis2q6xkYrqZoudJ4DDTA?pwd=bhyd" title="video_shoulder_lip_detection">video_shoulder_lip_detection</a> (password: bhyd). Please note that the detection results we provide are based on video segments that have been aligned through timestamp cropping (not from the original video). Due to algorithmic detection errors, we do not guarantee the accuracy of the detection results.
